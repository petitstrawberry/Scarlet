//! Unified Event IPC design using KernelObject pattern
//! 
//! This file outlines the refactoring plan to integrate Event IPC
//! into the KernelObject/HandleTable pattern used by other IPC mechanisms.

use crate::object::{KernelObject, capability::*};
use crate::ipc::{IpcError, EventType, Event, EventError};

/// Proposed KernelObject variants for Event IPC
/// 
/// These would be added to the main KernelObject enum in object/mod.rs:
/// ```rust
/// pub enum KernelObject {
///     File(Arc<dyn FileObject>),
///     Pipe(Arc<dyn PipeObject>),
///     EventChannel(Arc<dyn EventChannelObject>),  // <-- New
///     EventSubscription(Arc<dyn EventSubscriptionObject>),  // <-- New
/// }
/// ```

/// Event channel object trait - represents a named event channel
/// 
/// This provides a handle-based abstraction for event channels,
/// similar to how PipeObject works for pipes.
pub trait EventChannelObject: EventIpcOps + CloneOps {
    /// Get the channel name/identifier
    fn channel_name(&self) -> &str;
    
    /// Publish an event to this channel
    fn publish(&self, event: Event) -> Result<(), EventError>;
    
    /// Get subscriber count
    fn subscriber_count(&self) -> usize;
    
    /// Check if the channel is active (has subscribers or publishers)
    fn is_active(&self) -> bool;
    
    /// Get channel statistics
    fn get_stats(&self) -> ChannelStats;
}

/// Event subscription object trait - represents a subscription to events
/// 
/// This represents a "receiver" handle for events, similar to the read-end
/// of a pipe. Multiple subscriptions can exist for the same channel.
pub trait EventSubscriptionObject: EventIpcOps + CloneOps {
    /// Receive the next event (blocking or non-blocking)
    fn receive_event(&self, blocking: bool) -> Result<Event, EventError>;
    
    /// Check if events are available
    fn has_pending_events(&self) -> bool;
    
    /// Get the number of pending events
    fn pending_count(&self) -> usize;
    
    /// Get subscription filter
    fn get_filter(&self) -> Option<EventFilter>;
    
    /// Update subscription filter
    fn set_filter(&self, filter: Option<EventFilter>) -> Result<(), EventError>;
}

/// Channel statistics
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ChannelStats {
    pub subscriber_count: usize,
    pub events_published: u64,
    pub events_delivered: u64,
    pub events_dropped: u64,
}

/// Event filter for subscriptions
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct EventFilter {
    pub event_types: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub priority_threshold: Option<EventPriority>,
    pub source_filter: Option<TaskId>,
}

/// Proposed usage pattern:
/// 
/// 1. Create/open event channel:
///    ```rust
///    let channel_handle = handle_table.create_event_channel("system.notifications")?;
///    ```
/// 
/// 2. Subscribe to channel:
///    ```rust
///    let subscription_handle = handle_table.subscribe_to_channel(channel_handle, filter)?;
///    ```
/// 
/// 3. Publish events:
///    ```rust
///    let channel = handle_table.get(channel_handle)?.as_event_channel()?;
///    channel.publish(event)?;
///    ```
/// 
/// 4. Receive events:
///    ```rust
///    let subscription = handle_table.get(subscription_handle)?.as_event_subscription()?;
///    let event = subscription.receive_event(false)?;
///    ```

/// Implementation plan:
/// 
/// Phase 1: Create EventChannelObject and EventSubscriptionObject traits
/// Phase 2: Implement concrete types (EventChannel, EventSubscription)
/// Phase 3: Add KernelObject variants and HandleTable integration
/// Phase 4: Update existing EventManager to use handle-based approach
/// Phase 5: Migrate existing event syscalls to handle-based versions
/// Phase 6: Add proper resource management and cleanup

/// Benefits of this approach:
/// 
/// 1. Consistency: Events follow same pattern as pipes, files
/// 2. Resource management: Automatic cleanup via HandleTable/Drop
/// 3. Security: Handle-based access control
/// 4. Composability: Can combine with other IPC mechanisms
/// 5. Debugging: Standard introspection via handles
/// 6. Future extensibility: Easy to add new event types

/// Migration path:
/// 
/// 1. Keep existing EventManager as implementation detail
/// 2. Add new handle-based APIs alongside existing ones
/// 3. Gradually migrate users to handle-based APIs
/// 4. Remove old APIs once migration is complete
