    /// Memory usage analysis for different designs
    pub fn memory_usage_analysis() -> String {
        r#"Memory Usage Analysis:

Arc Parent Design:
- Memory growth: O(path_depth * accessed_files)
- Cleanup: Only when no references exist anywhere in subtree
- Risk: Memory leaks in cyclic mount scenarios
- Benefit: Guaranteed path consistency

Weak Parent Design (Current):
- Memory growth: O(actively_accessed_nodes)
- Cleanup: Immediate when no active references
- Risk: Temporary path inconsistency
- Benefit: Optimal memory usage, natural garbage collection

Real-world impact:
- Large directory trees (e.g., /usr with thousands of files)
- Arc: Entire tree stays in memory once accessed
- Weak: Only hot paths stay cached

    /// Performance characteristics comparison
    pub fn performance_analysis() -> String {
        r#"Performance Analysis:

Cache Hit Performance:
- Arc parent: O(1) - parent always available
- Weak parent: O(1) - parent available if cached
- Winner: Tie (both are O(1) for cached access)

Cache Miss Performance:
- Arc parent: O(1) - parent guaranteed to exist
- Weak parent: O(depth) - may need path reconstruction
- Winner: Arc parent (but rare in practice)

Memory Pressure Performance:
- Arc parent: Poor - cannot free memory under pressure
- Weak parent: Good - automatic cleanup under pressure
- Winner: Weak parent (critical for kernel)

Overall System Performance:
- Arc parent: Good for path-heavy workloads, poor for memory-constrained systems
- Weak parent: Good for balanced workloads, optimal for kernel environments
- Winner: Weak parent (better for OS kernel)

    /// Comparison with other operating systems
    pub fn os_comparison() -> String {
        r#"Comparison with Other Operating Systems:

Linux dentry cache:
- Uses Arc-like strong references for active dentries
- BUT: Has complex LRU shrinking mechanism
- Can evict parent dentries under memory pressure
- Uses RCU for safe concurrent access

FreeBSD namecache:
- vnodes don't inherently hold parent references
- Path information reconstructed via namecache lookup
- Similar to our Weak parent approach

Windows NT object manager:
- Object references are more complex
- Parent-child relationships managed separately from object lifetime

Scarlet VFS v2 Design Decision:
- Weak parent references for simplicity and memory efficiency  
- No complex LRU shrinking needed
- Natural garbage collection
- Reconstruction via filesystem driver lookup
- Optimal for microkernel/embedded environments

    /// Final design rationale
    pub fn design_rationale() -> String {
        r#"Final Design Rationale:

WHY Weak Parent References:

1. Kernel Memory Constraints:
   - Kernel heap is limited
   - Cannot afford memory leaks
   - Need predictable cleanup behavior

2. Simplicity:
   - No complex LRU mechanisms needed
   - No reference counting complications
   - Clear ownership semantics

3. Filesystem Semantics:
   - VfsEntry is a CACHE, not persistent storage
   - Actual file data lives in VfsNode
   - Path information can be reconstructed

4. Performance Trade-offs:
   - Slight performance cost on cache miss
   - BUT: Memory efficiency enables better overall performance
   - Cache hit performance unaffected

5. Future Extensibility:
   - Easier to add sophisticated caching later
   - No breaking changes to core design
   - Compatible with memory pressure handling

CONCLUSION: Weak parent references provide the best balance of
simplicity, memory efficiency, and performance for a kernel VFS.

impl PracticalExamples {
    /// Example 1: Build system with many temporary files
    pub fn build_system_example() -> String {
        r#"Build System Example:

Scenario: Compilation creates many temporary files in /tmp/build/

Arc Parent Design:
- /tmp entry stays in memory
- /tmp/build stays in memory  
- All intermediate .o files keep build/ alive
- Memory usage grows linearly with compilation
- Cleanup only after all files closed

Weak Parent Design:
- /tmp entry cached only while accessed
- /tmp/build cached only while files active
- Individual .o files don't prevent cleanup
- Memory usage stays constant
- Natural cleanup as compilation progresses

Result: Weak design provides better memory behavior for build workloads.

    /// Example 2: Web server serving static files
    pub fn web_server_example() -> String {
        r#"Web Server Example:

Scenario: Web server serving files from /var/www/html/

Arc Parent Design:
- /var, /var/www, /var/www/html permanently cached
- All parent directories stay in memory
- Memory usage proportional to directory depth
- Good for frequently accessed paths

Weak Parent Design:  
- Only actively served paths stay cached
- Parent directories cleaned up between requests
- Memory usage proportional to concurrent requests
- Path reconstruction on cache miss

Result: Weak design provides better memory efficiency, 
acceptable performance for typical web workloads.

    /// Example 3: Database with many temporary tables
    pub fn database_example() -> String {
        r#"Database Example:

Scenario: Database creating temporary tables in /var/lib/db/temp/

Arc Parent Design:
- /var/lib/db/temp stays permanently in memory
- Each temporary table keeps parent chain alive
- Memory grows with number of temporary tables
- Parent cleanup blocked by any remaining table

Weak Parent Design:
- /var/lib/db/temp cached only when accessed
- Temporary tables don't prevent parent cleanup
- Memory usage independent of temp table count
- Efficient cleanup as tables are dropped

Result: Weak design essential for database workloads with many temp objects.
